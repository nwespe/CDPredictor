## Project Description

I created CDPredictor.Pro as a Health Data Science Fellow in the Insight
program. The goal of this project was to generate a predictive model
based on hospital patient information to determine a patient's risk for
developing an infection with C. difficile. This project uses publicly
available, de-identified patient records from the MIMIC-III database
(https://mimic.physionet.org/). I queried and compiled relevant data
from the MIMIC database with SQL. I modeled outcomes using logistic
regression and random forest classification tools from the Scikit-Learn
library. To demonstrate the product's use case, I built an interactive
web application using Flask and AWS. This web app is viewable at
http://cdpredictor.pro.
